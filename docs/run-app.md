# Step 6: Run the Application

Now itâ€™s time to run Pedalogical locally and verify everything works.

## 1. Build and Run the App

From the root project folder:

```bash
dotnet run --project AiTutor
```

Or use:

```bash
dotnet watch run --project AiTutor
```

This will compile and start the web server.

## 2. Open in Browser

Visit:

```link
https://localhost:5001
```

(Or use the port displayed in your terminal)

## 3. Log In

Use the credentials from the seeded database (e.g., test@example.com / password123).

If you reach the dashboard, the environment is working correctly!

Congratulations! Your Pedalogical development environment is fully set up.
