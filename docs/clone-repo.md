# Step 2: Clone the Repository

## 1. Locate the Repository on GitHub (ensure you are logged in and have access to the repo)

Go to [https://github.com/wu-software-lab/AiTutor](https://github.com/wu-software-lab/AiTutor).

## 2. Clone the Repo

The instructions here and the rest of the guide assume your repo is being cloned into a `Repositories` directory in your home folder. Adjust paths as needed.

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# Change to your desired directory.
# Recommend having a Projects directory or similar.
# /Users/your-username/Projects.
cd ~/Repositories
git clone https://github.com/wu-software-lab/AiTutor.git
cd AiTutor
```
